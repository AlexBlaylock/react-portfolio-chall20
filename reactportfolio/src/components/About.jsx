                <p>
                   Finishing my bootcamp in December 2023, I am ready to hit the ground running with
                   my new knowledge, and push my capabilities and improve my quality as a developer. I strive to have a positive
                   and hard working attitude, and will continue this mindset pushing forward in a new environment.
